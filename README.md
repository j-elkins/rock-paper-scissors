My Rock, Paper, Scissors program - built in October 2021 as an assignment for The Odin Project.

The initial assignment was to write a program for Rock, Paper, Scissors that was played entirely using the console. This took me about 11 hours.

This was my first time writing a whole JavaScript program entirely from scratch and it was challenging. Breaking the project down into smaller steps and writing pseudo code was extremely helpful, and it was the first time I used these problem solving tools. I learned a lot about functions, parameters, scope, and program organization.

The next part of the assignment was to create a GUI, and rewrite the code so that the game was played using interactive buttons (instead of prompts and the console). This was completed using a combination of CSS/HTML/DOM Manipulation, which took me 6 hours.

By the end of this assignment I felt much more confident in defining variables, calling functions, and thinking more like a programmer. I gained valuable experience in creating an interactive UI using event listeners and a combination of JS DOM Manipulation and adding elements directly in HTML.
